# EDAD
This repository is the implementation of: An Encode-then-Decompose Approach for Unsupervised Time
Series Anomaly Detection. We propose the EDAD framework for unsupervised anomaly detection and evaluate its performance on nine open-source datasets.


## Get Started

1. Install Python 3.10, PyTorch >= 2.0.0, Wandb. Then run the following command.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Before running EDAD, download the publicly available dataset from the link xxx, unzip it and place it in the /dataset directory.



3. Use the following command to run the algorithm. 

    ```bash
    python main-all.py
    ```
